= Privacy Policy =
WP User Frontend uses [Appsero](https://appsero.com) SDK to collect some telemetry data upon user's confirmation. This helps us to troubleshoot problems faster & make product improvements.

Appsero SDK **does not gather any data by default.** The SDK only starts gathering basic telemetry data **when a user allows it via the admin notice**. We collect the data to ensure great user experience for all our users.

Integrating Appsero SDK **DOES NOT IMMEDIATELY** start gathering data, **without confirmation from users in any case.**

For example, if you have 3 subscription packs with 101, 102, 103 IDs and want to show only the last two packs then you can use `[wpuf_sub_pack include="102,103"]` or to exclude the middle one from the list then you can use `[wpuf_sub_pack exclude="102" order="DESC"]`.
 * **New:** Admin could not understand which users currently have subscription validity & what is the subscription pack a user is assigned to.

This option can be found as **"Show data in the post"** when editing custom fields under **"Advanced Options"** section.
